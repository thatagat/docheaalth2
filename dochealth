What Are Home Blood Tests?
Home blood tests involve the collection of blood samples from the comfort of your own home, rather than visiting a clinic or hospital. This service is designed to provide convenience, reduce the need for travel, and minimize the time spent waiting in a medical facility. Typically, a trained phlebotomist or healthcare professional visits your home, performs the blood draw, and then processes the sample at a certified laboratory.
